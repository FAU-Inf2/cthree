# cthree

This repository contains the evaluation results of the research paper "P. Kreutzer, G.  Dotzler, M. Ring, B. M. Eskofier, M. Philippsen: Automatic Clustering of Code Changes", as well as a simple Java tool to read in the data.

It also contains the tree differencing evaluation of the PhD thesis "G. Dotzler: Learning Code Transformations from Repositories, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, 2018".	https://doi.org/10.25593/978-3-96147-142-3

## Data Format

For each analyzed repository (see below), there is a compressed JSON file that contains the detected clusters of code changes. Use [lrzip](https://github.com/ckolivas/lrzip) to uncompress the archives. Warning: the uncompressed archives are huge!

Each code change is described by its relevant properties, including its file name, the method signatures of the changed method, and the human-readable diff. Each cluster contains a field `detectedBy` that describes which of the four combinations (see research paper) detected this group.

This repository also contains a sample Java application that shows how to read and process the JSON files. The code relies on the [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library to parse the JSON files (see `build.gradle`).

## Building and Running the Example Application

To build the example application type

```
./gradlew build
```

This creates the application jar `build/libs/cthree-all-1.0.jar`. One way to run it (at least on a Unix system), is gradle:

```
./gradlew executeLaseEvaluation -PappArgs="['JSON_FILE_PATH']" 
```
To print the phd thesis evaluation use:
```
./gradlew executeLaseEvaluation -PappArgs="['PATH_TO_ECLIPSE_JDT_JSON','PATH_TO_ECLIPSE_SWT_JSON' ]" 
```

## License

- the source code of the Java interface in `src/java/main` is licensed under the MIT license (see `LICENSE.mit`)
- `data` is licensed under the CC0 license (see `LICENSE.cc0`).
  - the code snippets cotained in each data file fall under the license of the respective project (see above)
